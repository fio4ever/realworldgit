# Plans for the future

My idea is to make this repo as _interactive_ as possible. Some crazy ideas:

* Be able to try conflicts
* Advanced rebase
* Bisect
* More complex single-user workflow
* Explain more the way git works
* Add more GUI examples

For the conflicts, I have the idea of setting an automatic process that every 5
min or so changes a file (1 line file). To simulate the conflict, the student
would have to just modify the content in that line.

A more complex conflict would be a similar approach, but with several lines or
in several files.

By doing that, we could prepare the student to learn how to react to rebase
conflicts, how to resolve conflicts, and perform a successful merge.

More ideas? send a PR :)
